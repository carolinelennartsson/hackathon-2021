## Challenge: Structural basis for solubility in protein expression systems

Large-scale protein production for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical applications rely on high protein solubility in expression systems. Solubility has been measured for a significant fraction of E. coli and S. cerevisiae proteomes and these datasets are routinely used to train predictors of protein solubility in different organisms. Thanks to continued advances in experimental structure-determination and modelling, many of these solubility measurements can now be paired with accurate structural models. It is the objective of this project to use our provided dataset of protein structure and solubility value pairs in order to produce a solubility predictor with comparable accuracy to sequence-based predictors reported in the literature. The provided dataset to be used in this project is created by following the dataset curation procedure of SOLart, and this hackathon project has a similar aim to this manuscript.
